# Our Mission

Science & Us is a youth-led organization that aims to:

1. Teach students about science communication, or explaining technical concepts in engaging, accessible ways using multimedia

2. Expose students to interdisciplinary career opportunities related to STEM, particularly science journalism, policy, advocacy, and outreach

Why? Regardless of your passion or profession, advancements in science influence some aspect of your life, as well as political, economic, social, and ethical issues that matter to communities far beyond academia. Not everyone needs or wants to become a scientist, but understanding the fundamentals of STEM and the scientific process is crucial and relies on effective communication.

# How We Achieve Our Mission

## Conference

The first Science & Us Conference was held at the Boston University Metcalf Science Center on Saturday, June 9, 2018. Eighty high school and middle school students from nearly thirty different schools in greater Boston registered, demonstrating widespread interest for this type of event. Approximately half of the registrants attended, and nearly 70 percent of attendees were female, as were all of the organizers.

The agenda included presentations, a careers panel, and interactive workshops by scientists, journalists, and other professionals from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics, Tufts University, Boston University, and STAT, a health and medicine news outlet produced by Boston Globe Media. These invited professionals spanned various fields (environmental conservation, mechanical engineering, infectious disease biology, history of science, international relations, etc.) and were at different stages in their careers (graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, professors, experienced author and entrepreneur, senior journalist), showcasing the diversity of possibilities available to students.
